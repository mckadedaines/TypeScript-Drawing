# Overview

As a software engineer constantly seeking to enhance my skills and understanding of various programming languages, I embarked on creating a simple yet interactive drawing application. This project was designed to dive deep into the capabilities of TypeScript in conjunction with HTML5 Canvas, focusing on the language's syntax, type safety, and object-oriented features. The purpose of crafting this software was not only to further my learning but also to explore how TypeScript can be utilized to build browser-based applications that are both efficient and scalable. 

This drawing application allows users to freely draw on a canvas with their mouse, providing an intuitive interface for creativity. Through the development of this project, I gained insights into TypeScript's powerful type system, its compatibility with modern web development standards, and how it enhances JavaScript code with type checking and advanced object-oriented programming capabilities.

# Development Environment

The development of this drawing app was facilitated by a range of tools and technologies, starting with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE). VS Code's comprehensive support for TypeScript, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection, significantly streamlined the coding process.

The project is built using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, making it ideal for developing large-scale applications that run in the browser. To manage the TypeScript compilation process and configure compiler options, the TypeScript Compiler (tsc) was used alongside a `tsconfig.json` file.

For version control and source code management, Git and GitHub were utilized, allowing for efficient tracking of changes and collaboration.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were instrumental in the completion of this project:

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and features I plan to implement in the future to improve the drawing application:

- **Undo and Redo Functionality:** Implementing features to undo and redo the last action, allowing users more flexibility in their drawing process.
- **Color and Brush Size Options:** Adding the ability to change the brush color and size, providing users with more creative control.
- **Save and Load Drawings:** Developing functionality to save drawings to the local filesystem and load them back into the application for further editing or viewing.
